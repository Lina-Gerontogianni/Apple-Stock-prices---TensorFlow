# Apple-Stock-prices-prediction---TensorFlow
Time series analysis via RNN with Tensorflow '2.9.1'.

Prediction of the Apple stock opening price on a daily basis for the 2020 time period, based on stock prices between 2015-2019. This dataset is taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suyashlakhani/apple-stock-prices-20152020).

The deployed machine learning model is a Long shot-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) which achieves low error (MSE = 0.0014), while being trained only for 60 epochs. 

The *apple_stock-prices.py script* and the prediction plot are provided.
